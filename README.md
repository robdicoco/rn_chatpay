# ChatPay Go Xion 🚀

A revolutionary mobile chat application that integrates blockchain payments with secure messaging, built on the Xion Network with Zero-Knowledge proof capabilities using Reclaim Protocol.

## 📱 Project Summary

**ChatPay Go Xion** is a cutting-edge mobile application that combines instant messaging with blockchain-based payments. Users can connect their Xion wallets, participate in incentive programs (such as Web3 student programs or global developer initiatives), and perform secure, fast, and private transactions directly within chat conversations.

The application addresses the growing need for seamless financial communication in the Web3 ecosystem, providing a user-friendly interface for blockchain interactions while maintaining privacy through Zero-Knowledge proofs.
